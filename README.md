A website that piqued my interest was : [website](https://www.getlago.com/blog/deepseek-open-source)

What’s really interesting about the article is how DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, managed to develop a model (R1) that competes with some of the best in the industry, like OpenAI’s, but did it on a very tight budget compared to the big players. Instead of relying on fancy, expensive hardware, they focused on being super efficient with what they had, partly because they’re limited by export restrictions on advanced tech. What’s even cooler is that they went fully open-source with their model, not just to gain credibility (especially in Western markets where trust is an issue), but also to challenge the idea that you need deep pockets and proprietary tools to succeed in AI. You can see its github repo online, which is also something that is REALLY cool.

This article was very interesting. I find it fascinating how a company like DeepSeek can compete with the very best without a lot of money. However, I think there are questions now around whether or not DeepSeek copied OpenAI's model. It will be very interesting in the future to see how this will shake up the AI industry.
