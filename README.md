A website that piqued my interest was : [website](https://www.getlago.com/blog/deepseek-open-source)

What’s really interesting about the article is how DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, managed to develop a model (R1) that competes with some of the best in the industry, like OpenAI’s, but did it on a very tight budget compared to the big players. Instead of relying on fancy, expensive hardware, they focused on being super efficient with what they had, partly because they’re limited by export restrictions on advanced tech. What’s even cooler is that they went fully open-source with their model, not just to gain credibility (especially in Western markets where trust is an issue), but also to challenge the idea that you need deep pockets and proprietary tools to succeed in AI. You can see its github repo online, which is also something that is REALLY cool.


## Comment from Lana Davydov
I found the reasoning behind DeepSeek’s decision to being open-source particularly interesting. Unlike traditional business logic, where a competitive advantage is protected in every way, DeepSeek leveraged being open-source as a strategic move to build trust among users and overcome geopolitical skepticism, especially in Western markets. Of course, in addition to building trust amongst users, being open-source is especially beneficial for engineers, as it opens doors for flexibility, innovation, and widespread knowledge. While OpenAI remains a current dominant player, it seems like DeepSeek can soon take its place in dominance.
